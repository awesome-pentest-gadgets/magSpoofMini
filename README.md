# magSpoofMini
My (miniature) version of Samy Kamkar's magspoof project.
Uses a DRV8835, and includes LiPo charge circuitry, micro USB port, and 5V boost converter to drive coil at a high enough voltage.
The only problem with this board is that the boost converter IC is the wrong footprint (I accidentally put the footprint for the 3.3V one instead), and needs to be bodged. I will upload a pic soon showing this.
